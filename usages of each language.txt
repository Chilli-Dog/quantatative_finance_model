Python fetches 1000 candles of AAPL from Alpaca.
Python sends that list of numbers to Rust.
Rust calculates the SMA and RSI across all 1000 candles in under 1 millisecond.
C++ runs a specific risk check (e.g., "Am I exceeding my daily loss limit?")
to ensure the trade is safe.
Python receives the "Go" signal and places the order via Alpaca.
